## This is a template file for a "generated" Makefile addition (in
## this case, "Makefile.swig.gen").  By including the top-level
## Makefile.swig, this file will be used to generate the SWIG
## dependencies.  Assign the variable TOP_SWIG_FILES to be the list of
## SWIG .i files to generated wrappings for; there can be more than 1
## so long as the names are unique (no sorting is done on the
## TOP_SWIG_FILES list). This file explicitly assumes that a SWIG .i
## file will generate .cc, .py, and possibly .h files -- meaning that
## all of these files will have the same base name (that provided for
## the SWIG .i file).
##
## This code is setup to ensure parallel MAKE ("-j" or "-jN") does the
## right thing.  For more info, see <
## http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html#Multiple-Outputs >

## Stamps used to ensure parallel make does the right thing.  These
## are removed by "make clean", but otherwise unused except during the
## parallel built.  These will not be included in a tarball, because

## Entry rule for running SWIG

# $(python_deps) $(guile_deps): qtgui.i
qtgui_python.h qtgui.py qtgui_python.cc: qtgui.i
## This rule will get called only when MAKE decides that one of the
## targets needs to be created or re-created, because:
##
## * The .i file is newer than any or all of the generated files;
##
## * Any or all of the .cc, .h, or .py files does not exist and is
##   needed (in the case this file is not needed, the rule for it is
##   ignored); or
##
## * Some SWIG-based dependecy of the .cc file isn't met and hence the
##   .cc file needs be be regenerated.  Explanation: Because MAKE
##   knows how to handle dependencies for .cc files (regardless of
##   their name or extension), then the .cc file is used as a target
##   instead of the .i file -- but with the dependencies of the .i
##   file.  It is this last reason why the line:
##
##     	if test -f $@; then :; else
##
##   cannot be used in this case: If a .i file dependecy is not met,
##   then the .cc file needs to be rebuilt.  But if the stamp is newer
##   than the .cc file, and the .cc file exists, then in the original
##   version (with the 'test' above) the internal MAKE call will not
##   be issued and hence the .cc file will not be rebuilt.
##
## Once execution gets to here, it should always proceed no matter the
## state of a stamp (as discussed in link above).  The
## $(DEPDIR)/qtgui-generate stuff is used to allow for parallel
## builds to "do the right thing".  The stamp has no relationship with
## either the target files or dependency file; it is used solely for
## the protection of multiple builds during a given call to MAKE.
##
## Catch signals SIGHUP (1), SIGINT (2), SIGPIPE (13), and SIGTERM
## (15).  At a caught signal, the quoted command will be issued before
## exiting.  In this case, remove any stamp, whether temporary of not.
## The trap is valid until the process exits; the process includes all
## commands appended via "\"s.

## Create a temporary directory, which acts as a lock.  The first
## process to create the directory will succeed and issue the MAKE
