This requires qt 3 or later.  See http://www.trolltech.com

To support the widgets needed for this code you need Qwt, available
from http://sourceforge.net/projects/qwt

For Linux, this may be obtained from:

  http://n4hy.org/Qwt/qwt-5.0.0.tar.bz2

On NetBSD or other pkgsrc systems, pkgsrc/x11/qwt exists and seems to
be a much older version linked against qt2.  You need qt3!


QTDIR is an environment variable that must be set for
gr-qtgui to make.

On Ubuntu with a standard apt-get or synaptic install,
this is done by:

export QTDIR=/usr/share/qt3

on Fedora Core 6 for example it is automatically set to 

/usr/lib/qt-3.3

by Qt install from the Fedora Core software setup.

If you are building from source from n4hy.org, the untar the bz2 ball,
cd into the qwt-5.0.0 directory and run

qmake

Now edit the file  qwtconfig.pri

and make the INSTALLBASE = /usr/local


run 

make
sudo make install

and qwt will be loaded into /usr/local/lib and the includes will be in
/usr/local/include

gr-qtgui will now make.




which must be run as root (as in sudo) so that files are
installed in the proper place for the gnuradio build
(such as qwt.pc).
