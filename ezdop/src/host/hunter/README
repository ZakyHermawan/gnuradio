The files in this directory are a prototype implementation of the AE6HO 
radio-location system.  It will not compile under the gnuradio build
system at this time, nor does the source code use the libezdop interface
to the EZ-Doppler hardware.  The build does not recurse into this directory
nor does the distribution tarball contain these files.

Over time this functionality will be migrated in the 'gnuradio way' over
to the gr-rdf component.

The files here are not officially part of the GNU Radio project, but are
here in the archive under GPL license as noted in the files.
