This module contains the GNU Radio 2.x code for the 
ATSC (HDTV) transmitter and receiver.

See http://www.atsc.org for specifications.  The most relevant ones
are XXX and YYY.


To build this, you must already have built and installed
gnuradio-core.  Then if you're building from a tarball:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ sudo make install

If you're building from CVS, you'll need to use this sequence, since
CVS doesn't contain configure or the generated Makefiles.

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ sudo make install


The doc directory is not built by default.  This is to avoid spurious
build problems on systems that don't have xmlto installed.  If you
have xmlto and its dependencies installed, you can build the html
version of the howto article by cd'ing to doc and invoking make.
