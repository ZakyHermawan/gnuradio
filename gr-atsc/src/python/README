Currently the best, fastest software decode is by using
19.2MSps over 5 processes.

1) Capture data - adjust gain (-g) frequency (-f) and which side
the tvrx is on to fit your local setup:

usrp_rx_cfile -R B -d 10 -g 65 -f 503e6 atsc_data_6-4m_complex 


2) Make pipes:

mkfifo /tmp/atsc_pipe_1
mkfifo /tmp/atsc_pipe_2
mkfifo /tmp/atsc_pipe_3
mkfifo /tmp/atsc_pipe_4
mkfifo /tmp/atsc_pipe_5

3) In seperate windows run processes:

./interp.py <input rf data at 6.4Msps>
./xlate.py
./fpll.py
./btl-fsd.py
./viterbi-out.py <output mpeg transport stream>


Status: Not fully working.

Currently gr-atsc 2.x will produce the exact amount of data as a working system,
but there are a some differences in the output. If you substitute the btl-fsd.py
block with the corresponding code from gnuradio-0.9 it works.
