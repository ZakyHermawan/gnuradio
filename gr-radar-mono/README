This GNU Radio component implements (will implement) a monostatic 
radar transmitter and receiver.  It uses (will use) a custom FPGA 
build to generate a linear FM chip waveform directly in the USRP.
Echo returns are (will be) recorded to a file.

Currently, only a CW signal is generated for testing the frequency
response of the FPGA code, AD9862, and daughterboard mixer.

This is experimental code.
