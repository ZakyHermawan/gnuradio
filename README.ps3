GNU Radio may be compiled natively on the Sony PlayStation 3 if you're
extremely patient.  It takes a _long_ time because there's only 256MB
of RAM on board and you'll be doing a lot of paging.

However, it is possible to cross compile GNU Radio -- from say a big
x86_64 box running Fedora 7 -- and generate code for the PS3.
