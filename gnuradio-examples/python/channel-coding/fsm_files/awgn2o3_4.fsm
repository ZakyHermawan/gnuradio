This is generated by the 1/2 AWGN code (5 7) by puncturing the first (MSB) bit.
--> d_free=3

before puncturing:

00 03 31 32
30 33 01 02
13 10 22 21
23 20 12 11

or in decimal representation:

 0  3 13 14
12 15  1  2
 7  4 10  9
11  8  6  5

by punturing the MSB you get (dmin=3)

0 3 5 6
4 7 1 2
7 4 2 1
3 0 6 5 

and by puncturing the LSB (something is wrong with this code)
