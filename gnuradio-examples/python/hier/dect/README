This directory contains a work in progress service monitor for DECT
digital cordless phone base stations and handsets.


Status

DECT Modulation Details
-----------------------

In the US, the FCC has allocated four carrier frequencies for DECT usage:

Channel		Frequency
-------		---------
   1		1921.536 MHz
   2		1923.264 MHz
   3		1924.992 MHz
   4		1926.720 MHz

These are spaced at 1.728 MHz intervals.

The DECT PHY uses GMSK with a 0.5 bandwidth-time product at 1.152 Msym/sec,
for an occupied bandwidth (99% power) of 1.186 MHz (1.03 x symbol rate.)
