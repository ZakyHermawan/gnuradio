Welcome!

This package is a collection of examples for the GNU Radio 2.x toolkit.

They assume that at a minimum, you've got the gnuradio-core
package installed.  In addition, depending on what i/o devices you
have, you may want to consider installing:

  gr-usrp		: support for Universal Software Radio Peripheral (Rev 1)
  gr-audio-oss		: sound card support using OSS
  gr-audio-alsa		: sound card support using ALSA
  gr-audio-osx		: sound card support for OS/X
  gr-mc4020		: Measurement Computing PCI-DAS 4020/12 A/D card


You'll need to set your PYTHONPATH environment variable so that the
GNU Radio toolkit and optional packages can be found by python.

PYTHONPATH should include the path of the local site-packages
directory.  It has the general form:

  ${prefix}/lib/python${pythonversion}/site-packages

If the above packages were installed using the default prefix
(/usr/local) and you're using python 2.3, this should work:

  $ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages

You may want to add this to your ~/.bash_profile or similar file.


Once PYTHONPATH is set, you should be able to run any of the examples
for which you have the required i/o devices.

To ensure that your setup is sane, try this:

  $ python
  >>> from gnuradio import gr

If this works, your PYTHONPATH is set correctly.


Have fun!
