Tools / Waveforms
	
	- non_gr_snapshot_tool
		simple tool to capture
		fixed length snapshots to a file
		compile with make and run 
		with ./cap4
		edit client5.cc variables to 
		set parameters.

		./plot_psd.py <cap file>
		and
		./spectrogram.py <cap file>
	
		may be used for analysis

	- python-examples/new_msdd/fft.py
		A clone of the original usrp_fft.py
		adapted to work with the new msdd.source_simple
		source block.
		run ./new_msdd_fft.py -W 
		for waterfall mode.
		

GNU Radio Blocks,

	- msdd.source_simple
		this block produces a stream of
		interleaved complex shorts and 
		currently works with FAPP.LDR
		
		if you want complex floats,
		put a gr.interleaved_short_to_complex()
		block immidiately following.

	
	- msdd.source_s / source_c / source_base
		These were written with the
		old TCP based app.ldr protocol
		and will no longer work.
		data was never streamed
		without discontinuities
		through this method.
