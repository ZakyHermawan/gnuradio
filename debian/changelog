  * new upstream version
  * tweak gnuradio-doc package to eliminate spurious subdirectory level
  * add a usrp-doc binary package, recommended by the usrp package, and 
    include xmlto in build dependencies so usrp_guide.html gets generated, 
    closes: #407368

 -- Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com>  Sun, 11 Mar 2007 23:55:32 -0600

gnuradio (3.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * add run-time dependency on python-wxgtk2.6.  leaving urgency high since 
    this would be a silly bug to release etch with if we can avoid it.

 -- Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com>  Mon,  4 Dec 2006 15:35:53 -0700

gnuradio (3.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

 -- Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com>  Sun, 12 Nov 2006 14:52:33 -0800

gnuradio (3.0-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * put python-all-dev back in the build-depends list, closes: #398246
  * move gr-wxgui conflicts/depends to python-gnuradio, closes: #396302
  * fix up sections in control to match overrides

 -- Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com>  Sun, 12 Nov 2006 10:59:58 -0800

gnuradio (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * reworked package dependencies so that the 'gnuradio' binary package no
    longer depends on the pieces in contrib.  instead, the 'usrp' binary
    package in contrib now depends on all the USRP-related pieces.  A user
    who doesn't have a USRP board can just install 'gnuradio' and get all
    the relevant pieces, a USRP user needs to install both 'gnuradio' and
    'usrp'.  Closes: #394533
  * improve consistency of references to 'GNU Radio' as upstream project name
  * make the gnuradio package dependencies on python-gnuradio and python-usrp
    be version specific on suggestion from Ramakrishnan Muthukrishnan

gnuradio (3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new maintainer, new upstream version
  * Restructuring source and binary packages to follow upstream changes, more
    or less repackaging from scratch taking ideas from the previous packaging
    by Ramakrishnan Muthukrishnan and Steinar H. Gunderson.  This single 
    source package replaces all of: 
        gnuradio-core
        gnuradio-examples
        gr-audio-alsa
        gr-audio-jack
        gr-audio-oss
        gr-usrp
        gr-wxgui
        usrp
    In addition, the 'gnuradio' binary package is a new meta-package that 
    conveniently depends on everything gnuradio related to ease installation.
