This GNU Radio component implements (will implement) common radiopager
signaling protocols such as POCSAG and FLEX.

Current status (10/6/06):

FLEX receiving is completed except for addition of BCH error correction.

pager.slicer_fb()         Accepts a complex baseband downconverted channel 
                          and outputs 4-level FSK symbols [0-3] as bytes.

pager.flex_sync()	  Accepts 4FSK symbol stream at channel rate and
			  outputs four phases of FLEX data bits as bytes.
			  Auto-shifts to 3200 bps as determined by received
			  FLEX synchronization word.
			
pager.flex_deinterleave() Accepts a single phase of FLEX data bits and performs
			  deinterleaving on 256-bit blocks.  Resulting code
			  words are error corrected using BCH 32,21 ecc (stub)
			  and converted into FLEX data words for output.

pager.flex_parse()	  Sink block that accepts a single phase of FLEX data 
			  words and unpacks and parses individual pages. These are 
			  passed outside the data plane via gr_message's.

pager.flex_decode()       Combines the above blocks correctly to convert
                          from downconverted baseband to pager messages

usrp_flex.py              Instantiates USRP receive chain to receive FLEX
                          protocol pages.  See command-line help for options.
			  Right now this installs into $PREFIX/bin but will
                          probably make it into gnuradio-examples.

aypabtu.py		  Decodes FLEX pages from multiple rx channels in a range.
		          Incomplete.
