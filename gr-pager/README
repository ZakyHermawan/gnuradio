This GNU Radio component implements (will implement) common radiopager
signaling protocols such as POCSAG and FLEX.

Current status (9/28/06):

FLEX receiving is nearing completion.

pager.slicer_fb()         Accepts a complex baseband downconverted channel 
                          and outputs 4-level FSK symbols [0-3] as bytes.
			  This may migrate into gnuradio-core at some point.

pager.flex_sync()	  Accepts 4FSK symbol stream at channel rate and
			  outputs four phases of FLEX data bits as bytes.
			  Auto-shifts to 3200 bps as determined by received
			  FLEX synchronization word.
			
pager.flex_deinterleave() Accepts a single phase of FLEX data bits and performs
			  deinterleaving on 256-bit blocks.  Resulting code
			  words are error corrected using BCH 32,21 ecc (stub)
			  and converted into FLEX data words for output.

pager.flex_parse()	  Sink block that accepts a single phase of FLEX data 
			  words and unpacks and parses individual pages.
			  Currently, this block decodes the capcodes of each
			  receive page and displays the page type, but not yet
			  the contents.

pager.flex_decode()       Combines the above blocks correctly to convert
                          from downconverted baseband to pager messages

usrp_flex.py              Instantiates USRP receive chain to receive FLEX
                          protocol pages.  See command-line help for options.
			  Right now this installs into $PREFIX/bin but will
                          probably make it into gnuradio-examples.
