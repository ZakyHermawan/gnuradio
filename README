Welcome to GNU Radio!


As of August 3, 2006 we have restructured the GNU Radio build process
and moved the source code repository from CVS to subversion.

Please see http://gnuradio.utah.edu/trac for the wiki, bug tracking,
and source code viewer.

The bleeding edge code can be found in our subversion repository at
http://gnuradio.utah.edu/svn.  To checkout the latest, use this
command:

  $ svn co http://gnuradio.utah.edu/svn/gnuradio/trunk gnuradio

For information about subversion, please see:
  http://subversion.tigris.org/



GNU Radio is now distributed as one giant blob, instead of N smaller
blobs.  We believe that this will reduce some of the build problems
people were seeing.  Now you'll always get all of the code, and the
configure step will determine which components can be built on your
system.


How to Build GNU Radio:

  (1) Ensure that you've satisfied the external dependencies listed
      below.  With the exception of SDCC, the following GNU/Linux
      distributions are known to come with all required dependencies
      pre-packaged: Ubuntu 6.06, SuSE 10.0 (the pay version, not the
      free download), Fedora Core 5.  Other distribution may work too.
      We know these three are easy.  The required packages may be
      contained on your installation CD/DVD, or may be loaded over the
      net.  The specifics vary depending on your GNU/Linux
      distribution.  See the wiki at
      http://gnuradio.utah.edu/trac/wiki for details.

      FIXME: update the wiki; talk about OS/X, NetBSD and MinGW too.

  (2) do the "usual dance"

      $ ./bootstrap        # not reqd when building from the tarball
      $ ./configure
      $ make && make check
      $ sudo make install


That's it!

		       KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES


  GNU Radio triggers bugs in g++ 3.3 for X86.  DO NOT USE GCC 3.3 on
  the X86 platform.  g++ 3.2, 3.4, and the 4.* series are known to work well.

			  External dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites: Before trying to build these from source, please try
your installation tool (apt-get, YaST, yum, urpmi, etc.) first.
Contemporary distributions have these packages available.

You'll need to do a bit of sleuthing to figure out what your OS and
packaging system calls these.  If your system has both a foo and a
foo-devel package, install them both.


(1) The "autotools"

       autoconf 2.57    or later
       automake 1.7.4   or later
       libtool  1.5     or later

If your system has automake-1.4, there's a good chance it also has
automake-1.7 or later.  Check your install disk and/or try:

  $ man update-alternatives

for info on how some distributions support multiple versions.


(2)  pkgconfig 0.15.0 or later  http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/pkgconfig

From the web site:

pkgconfig is a system for managing library compile/link flags that
works with automake and autoconf. It replaces the ubiquitous *-config
scripts you may have seen with a single tool.


(3)  FFTW 3.0 or later	      http://www.fftw.org

IMPORTANT!!!  When building FFTW, you MUST use the --enable-single and
--enable-shared configure options.  This builds the single precision
floating point version which we use.  You should also use either the
--enable-3dnow or --enable-sse options if you're on an Athlon or Pentium
respectively.


(4) Python 2.3 or later	      http://www.python.org

Python 2.3 or later is now required.  If your distribution splits
python into a bunch of separate RPMS including python-devel or
libpython you'll most likely need those too.


(5) Numeric python library   http://numeric.scipy.org

Provides a high performance array type for Python.
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=1351


(6) The Boost C++ Libraries	http://www.boost.org

We use the Smart Pointer library.  Your distribution almost certainly
has the boost libraries available.  In the unlikely event that it
doesn't, download the source and follow the build instructions.
They're different from the normal ./configure && make


(7) cppunit 1.9.14 or later.	http://cppunit.sourceforge.net

Unit testing framework for C++.


(8) Simple Wrapper Interface Generator.  http://www.swig.org

These versions are known to work:
  1.3.23, 1.3.24, 1.3.25, 1.3.27, 1.3.28, 1.3.29


(9) SDCC: Small Device C Compiler.  http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/

Use version 2.4.0 or later.

This includes a C compiler and linker for the 8051.  It's required to
build the firmware for the USRP.  If you don't have a USRP, don't
worry about it.


Optional, but nice to have:

(10) wxPython.  Python binding for the wxWidgets GUI framework.  
Use version 2.5.2.7 or later.  Again, your distribution almost
certainly has this available.

As a last resort, build it from source (not recommended!)
http://www.wxpython.org


----------------------------------------------------------------

If you've got doxygen installed and provide the --enable-doxygen
configure option, the build process creates documentation for the
class hierarchy etc.  Point your browser at
gnuradio/gnuradio-core/doc/html/index.html


To run the examples you'll need to set PYTHONPATH.
Note that the python version number in the path needs to match your
installed version of python.

  $ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages

You may want to add this to your ~/.bash_profile


Another handy trick if for example your fftw includes and libs are
installed in, say ~/local/include and ~/local/lib, instead of
/usr/local is this:

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/local/lib
    $ make CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/local/include"
